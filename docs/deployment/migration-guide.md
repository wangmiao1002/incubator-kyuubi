# Kyuubi Migration Guide

## Upgrading from Kyuubi 1.7.0 to 1.7.1

* Since Kyuubi 1.7.1, `protocolVersion` is removed from the request parameters of the REST API `Open(create) a session`. All removed or unknown parameters will be silently ignored and affects nothing.

## Upgrading from Kyuubi 1.6 to 1.7

* In Kyuubi 1.7, `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.engine.auth.type` does not fallback to `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.type`.  
  When Kyuubi engine does Kerberos authentication with Zookeeper, user needs to explicitly set `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.engine.auth.type` to `KERBEROS`.
* Since Kyuubi 1.7, Kyuubi returns engine's information for `GetInfo` request instead of server. To restore the previous behavior, set `kyuubi.server.info.provider` to `SERVER`.
* Since Kyuubi 1.7, Kyuubi session type `SQL` is refactored to `INTERACTIVE`, because Kyuubi supports not only `SQL` session, but also `SCALA` and `PYTHON` sessions.
  User need to use `INTERACTIVE` sessionType to look up the session event.
* Since Kyuubi 1.7, the REST API of `Open(create) a session` will not contain parameters `user` `password` and `IpAddr`. User and password should be set in `Authorization` of http request if needed.

## Upgrading from Kyuubi 1.6.0 to 1.6.1

* Since Kyuubi 1.6.1, `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.engine.auth.type` does not fallback to `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.type`.  
  When Kyuubi engine does Kerberos authentication with Zookeeper, user needs to explicitly set `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.engine.auth.type` to `KERBEROS`.

## Upgrading from Kyuubi 1.5 to 1.6

* Kyuubi engine gets Zookeeper principal & keytab from `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.principal` & `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.keytab`.    
  `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.principal` & `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.keytab` fallback to `kyuubi.kinit.principal` & `kyuubi.kinit.keytab` when not set.    
  Since Kyuubi 1.6, `kyuubi.kinit.principal` & `kyuubi.kinit.keytab` are filtered out from Kyuubi engine's conf for better security.  
  When Kyuubi engine does Kerberos authentication with Zookeeper, user needs to explicitly set `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.principal` & `kyuubi.ha.zookeeper.auth.keytab`.
