Connectors for Spark SQL Query Engine
=====================================

The Kyuubi Spark SQL Query Engine uses Spark DataSource APIs(V1/V2) to access
data from different data sources.

By default, it provides accessibility to hive warehouses with various file formats
supported, such as parquet, orc, json, etc.

Also，it can easily integrate with other third-party libraries, such as Hudi,
Iceberg, Delta Lake, Kudu, Apache Paimon (Incubating), HBase，Cassandra, etc.

We also provide sample data sources like TDC-DS, TPC-H for testing and benchmarking
purpose.
